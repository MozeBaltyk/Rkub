## Description

This Project is mainly inspired from [Clemenko/rke_airgap_install](https://github.com/clemenko/rke_airgap_install/blob/main/air_gap_all_the_things.sh). 
I tried it and the idea pleased me but I had small frustrations about the Shell scripting limitations. So I decided to rewrite it in Ansible.  

With Ansible:
- Idempotency: can be relaunch multiple time. 
- User agnostic: can be launch any user (with sudo rights). 
- OS agnositc: can be launch on any Linux systems (at least for the package build, for the install depend on your participation to this project ðŸ˜¸)

Add-on from my part:
- Some part which were manual in Clemenko procedure are automated with Ansible (like the download)
- Arkade to install utilities binaries
- Nerdctl (as complement of containerd) 
- Firewalld settings if firewalld is activated
- Uninstall playbook to cleanup (and maybe reinstall)

## Prerequisites

* Linux Host as a package builder (can be a VM or your WSL)

* An Ansible Controler, can be the same host for ansible and for building package, at your convenience...

* 3 RHEL-like hosts for the cluster RKE2.

## Getting started

1. Clone the project on local machine which have an access.

2. Build your package by running:  `ansible-playbook playbooks/tasks/build.yml`

By default, it will download everything in `$HOME/rkub` but can be redefined with `-e dir_build=$HOME/rkub2`.
Count 30G of free space in your build directory (17G for download + 7G for the zst package).
this part works on Debian-like and Redhat-like.

3. Push your package to first controler:  `ansible-playbook playbooks/tasks/download.yml`

By default, it will download everything in `$HOME/rkub` but can be redefined with `-e dir_build=$HOME/rkub2`.
Count 30G of free space on your target directory (7G for the zst package + 17G to unarchive the package).

4. Start installation: `ansible-playbook playbooks/tasks/install.yml`

## Roadmap
milestones:
- To deploy sone staffs
- To add flavors

Improvment:
- Add a option to chooce by url or by copy
