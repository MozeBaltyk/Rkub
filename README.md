This Project is mainly inspired from [Clemenko/rke_airgap_install](https://github.com/clemenko/rke_airgap_install/blob/main/air_gap_all_the_things.sh).
I tried it and like the idea but I was frustrated with Shell scripting limitations. So I decided to rewrite it in Ansible.

With Ansible:

* Idempotency: can be relaunch multiple time.

* User agnostic: can be launch by any user (with sudo rights).

* OS agnositc: can be launch on any Linux systems (at least for the package build, for the install depend on your participation to this project ðŸ˜¸)

Add-on from my part, some part which were manual in Clemenko procedure are automated with Ansible like:

* the upload or NFS mount

* Some flexibility about path (possible to export or mount NFS in choosen place)

* Arkade to install utilities binaries

* Admin user (by default kuberoot) on first controler node with all necessary tools

* Nerdctl (as complement of containerd to handle oci-archive)

* Firewalld settings if firewalld running

* Uninstall playbook to cleanup (and maybe reinstall if needed)

* Collection Released, so possibilty to get back to older versions


## Prerequisites

* Linux Host as a package builder (can be a VM or your WSL). Count 30G of free space in the build directory of your package builder (17G for download + 7G for the zst package).

* An Ansible Controler, can be the same host for ansible and for building package, at your convenience...

* A minimum of 2 hosts RHEL-like (2 vCPU and 8G of RAM) for the cluster RKE2 with 80G at least on target directory.


## Getting started

1. Preparation steps:

    * Clone this project on local machine which have an internet access.

    * Execute `make prerequis` to install all prerequisites defined in meta directory.

    * Complete directory inside `./plugins/inventory/hosts.yml`.

2. Build your package by running (works on Debian-like and Redhat-like):
```sh
ansible-playbook playbooks/tasks/build.yml         # All arguments below are not mandatory
-e dir_build="$HOME/rkub"                          # Directory where to upload everything (count 30G)
-e package_name="rke2_rancher_longhorn.zst"        # Name of the package, by default rke2_rancher_longhorn.zst
-u admin -Kk                                       # Other Ansible Arguments (like -vvv)
```

3. Push your package to first controler:
```sh
ansible-playbook playbooks/tasks/upload.yml        # All arguments below are not mandatory
-e package_path=/home/me/rke2_rancher_longhorn.zst # Will be prompt if not given in the command
-e dir_target=/opt                                 # Directory where to sync and unarchive (by default /opt, count 50G available)
-u admin -Kk                                       # Other Ansible Arguments (like -vvv)
```

4. Start installation:
```sh
ansible-playbook playbooks/tasks/install.yml       # All arguments below are not mandatory
-e dir_target=/opt                                 # Dir on first master where to find package unarchive by previous task (by default /opt, count 50G available)
-e dir_mount=/mnt/rkub                             # NFS mount point (on first master, it will be a symlink to "dir_target")
-e domain="example.com"                            # By default take the host domain from master server
-u admin -Kk                                       # Other Ansible Arguments (like -vvv)
```

5. Deploy Rancher:
```sh
ansible-playbook playbooks/tasks/rancher.yml       # All arguments below are not mandatory
-e dir_mount=/mnt/rkub                             # NFS mount point, by default value is /mnt/rkub
-e domain="example.com"                            # Domain use for ingress, by default take the host domain from master server
-e password="BootStrapAllTheThings"                # Default password is "BootStrapAllTheThings"
-u admin -Kk                                       # Other Ansible Arguments (like -vvv)
```

6. Deploy Longhorn:
```sh
ansible-playbook playbooks/tasks/longhorn.yml      # All arguments below are not mandatory
-e dir_mount=/mnt/rkub                             # NFS mount point, by default value is /mnt/rkub
-e domain="example.com"                            # Domain use for ingress, by default take the host domain from master server
-e datapath="/opt/longhorn"                        # Longhorn Path for PVC, by default equal "{{ dir_target }}/longhorn".
                                                   # The best is to have a dedicated LVM filesystem for this one.
-u admin -Kk                                       # Other Ansible Arguments (like -vvv)
```

7. Deploy Neuvector
```sh
ansible-playbook playbooks/tasks/neuvector.yml     # All arguments below are not mandatory
-e dir_mount=/mnt/rkub                             # NFS mount point, by default value is /mnt/rkub
-e domain="example.com"                            # Domain use for ingress, by default take the host domain from master server
-u admin -Kk                                       # Other Ansible Arguments (like -vvv)
```

8. Bonus:

With make command, all playbooks above are in the makefile. `make` alone display options and small descriptions.

```bash
# Example with make
make install                                       # All arguments below are not mandatory
ANSIBLE_USER=admin                                 # equal to '-u admin'
"OPT=-e domain=example.com -Kk"                    # redefine vars or add options to ansible-playbook command
```

## Container methode

1. This is a custom script which imitate Execution-Environement:

    * `make ee-container` will load an UBI-8 image and execute inside `make prerequis`

    * `make ee-exec` Run image with collection and package zst mounted inside. Launch playbook or make command as described above.

All prerequisites are set in folder `meta` and `meta/execution-environment.yml`. So it's possible to use ansible-builder (though not tested yet).

## Some details

**Build** have for purpose to create a tar zst with following content:

```bash
rkub
â”œâ”€â”€ helm          # all helm charts
â”œâ”€â”€ images        # all images
â”‚Â Â  â”œâ”€â”€ cert
â”‚Â Â  â”œâ”€â”€ longhorn
â”‚Â Â  â”œâ”€â”€ neuvector
â”‚Â Â  â”œâ”€â”€ rancher
â”‚Â Â  â””â”€â”€ registry
â”œâ”€â”€ rke2_1.26.11  # RKE2 binaries
â””â”€â”€ utils         # utilities packages downloaded with arkade
```

**upload** push the big monster packages (around 7G) and unarchive on first node on chosen targeted path.

**install** RKE2 (currently only one master) with:
  - An admin user (by default `kuberoot`) on first master with some administation tools like `k9s` `kubectl` or `helm`.
  - Master export NFS with all the unarchive content + registry content
  - Workers mount the NFS to get above content
  - A minimal registry is deploy on each nodes pointing to the NFS mount and responding to `localhost:5000`
  - Nerdctl as complement to containerd and allow oci-archive
  - Firewalld settings if firewalld running

**deploy** keeping this order, *Rancher*, *Longhorn*, *Neuvector*
  - Those are simple playbooks which deploy with helm charts
  - It use the default ingress from RKE2 *Nginx-ingress* in https (currently Self-sign certificate)
  - *Rancher* need *Certmanager*, So it deploy first Certmanager

## Roadmap

Milestones:

* More install customization and options

* HA masters with kubevip

* Add a option to chooce by url mode or airgap mode

Improvments:

* Improve collection to run as true collection

* CI
